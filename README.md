# FinalYearProject-ReinforcementLearning
Final year project as part of a Royal Holloway University of London BSc in Computer Science.
This project demonstrates reinforcement learning techniques in a configurable and viewable environment. It exposes learning variables and key information to the user, to be modified and experimented upon.
Features experiments over thousands of simulations viewable on a graph, saveable grid world environments, and a generic reinforcement learning system.
